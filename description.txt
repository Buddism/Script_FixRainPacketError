Description:
client fix works on all servers!
since this is a bug that can be fixed on either the server or the client i have included both methods

all precipitation use the first datablock in the datablockgroup which is always 3, or dummyPlayer
which is an issue because when you make a datablock on the client side (which you should not do)
the client REPLACES server datablocks starting from 3 onwards
AvatarGui::onWake (%this) creates a datablock datablock TSShapeConstructor (mDts)
